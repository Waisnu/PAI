# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project Tasks

## Activity 1: Data Loading & Exploration
- Load the dataset using Pandas
- Display the first and last 5 rows of the DataFrame
- Identify and handle missing values
- Drop columns with over 90% missing values 
- Convert the date column to datetime format

## Activity 2: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Impute missing values in relevant columns
- Remove duplicate rows
- Create new features (e.g., extract year and month from the date)
- Identify unique countries and count total entries

## Activity 3: Global COVID-19 Overview
- Visualize total COVID-19 cases and deaths by WHO region using bar plots
- Plot the global monthly trend of COVID-19 cases (line plot)
- Use a heatmap to show correlation between total cases and deaths
- Plot total cases over time for a specific country (e.g., India)

## Activity 4: Regional Analysis
- Create a grouped bar chart showing new cases by continent and month
- Display yearly distribution of total cases using a box plot
- Compare total deaths across continents (bar plot)
- Plot monthly total case trends

## Activity 5: Time Series Analysis
- Line plots for daily trends of new cases and new deaths globally
- Calculate and plot daily averages of new cases and deaths
- Visualize global vaccination coverage trends over time
- Analyze global trends in testing and positivity rates

## Activity 6: In-Depth Country Analysis
- Visualize the evolution of total cases and deaths over time for a chosen country
- Accept user input for country and metric (total_cases or total_deaths) and plot a line chart
- Box plot of total cases by continent
- Monthly trend analysis of new cases for the selected country, grouped by year

## Activity 7: Additional Insights
- Plot global fatality rate over time (total_deaths / total_cases)
- Use a scatter plot (log scale on x-axis) to explore positivity rate vs. number of tests
- Investigate fatality rate correlation with male and female smoking rates
- Create a heatmap showing correlation between hospital beds per thousand and fatality rate
