* Access and understand the Project Brief, Report template, and how to use them.
* Access to the technical environment specified.
* Understand the number and scope of milestones for each tutoring session.
* Recommended tools:

  * MS Windows/Mac with Anaconda, Python, Azure Data Studio, VS Code
  * OR use Google Colab

---

## **3. Project Outcomes & Deliverables**

* Complete all tasks in the task list.
* Create `.py` or `.ipynb` files with the implementation.
* Prepare a project report using the pre-defined template.

## **4. Project Definition**

ABC Health Analytics is launching a project for comprehensive analysis and visualization of worldwide COVID-19 data using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The dataset is from **Our World in Data**, including global COVID-19 metrics.

---

## **5. Project Task List**

### **Activity 1: Data Loading and Exploration**

1. Load dataset using Pandas
2. Show first and last 5 rows
3. Check and handle missing values
4. Drop columns with >90% missing values
5. Convert 'date' column to datetime

---

### **Activity 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**

1. Impute missing values
2. Remove duplicate rows
3. Create features (e.g., extract year/month from date)
4. Count unique countries

---

### **Activity 3: Worldwide COVID-19 Overview**

1. Bar plot: WHO regions with total cases and deaths
2. Line plot: Worldwide monthly trend
3. Heatmap: Correlation between total cases and deaths
4. Time evolution for a country (e.g., India)

---

### **Activity 4: Regional Analysis**

1. Grouped bar chart: New cases by continent and month
2. Box plot: Total cases by year
3. Bar plot: Deaths by continent
4. Bar plot: Monthly total cases

---

### **Activity 5: Time Series Analysis**

1. Line plots: Daily new cases and deaths
2. Average daily cases and deaths
3. Vaccination trend over time
4. Testing and positive rate trend

---

### **Activity 6: In-Depth Country Analysis**

1. Plot: Total cases and deaths over time (specific country)
2. User input: Country and metric, plot line chart
3. Box plot: Total cases by continent
4. Line plot: Year-wise monthly new cases for selected country

---

### **Activity 7: Additional Insights**

1. Fatality rate over time
2. Positivity rate vs. total tests (log scale x-axis)
3. Correlation of fatality rate with smoking (male/female)
4. Heatmap: Hospital beds vs. fatality rate

---

## **6. Project Evidence**

* Submit a report with **screenshots for each activity** to confirm task completion.

---

## **7. Project Guidelines**

* Use the specified technical environment
* Follow the defined format for the project report
* Submit the report at least **1 day before** summative assessment
* Present and get feedback on milestones during tutoring sessions
* Include all project evidence per milestone

---

## **8. Technical Environment**

Use Colab or Jupyter Notebook with Python and the provided dataset.

---
